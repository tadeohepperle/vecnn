Table: Comparision of my implementation of HNSW compared to 2 other rust impls, faiss and hnswlib.
- Fix parameters for all of them, Use sisap datasets: variable n=10000,100000,30000, k=30, m_max = 20,40, ef = 40, 80, 160
- table with metrics: recall, build time, search time, 

- in our own hnsw impl: n => number of distance calculations
